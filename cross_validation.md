Cross Validation

## Cross validation

``` r
nonlin_df = 
  tibble(
    id = 1:100,
    x = runif(100, 0, 1),
    y = 1 - 10 * (x - .3) ^ 2 + rnorm(100, 0, .3)
  )

nonlin_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y)) + 
  geom_point() + theme_bw()
```

Training and testing

Cross validation by hand

``` r
train_df = sample_frac(nonlin_df, size = .8)
test_df = anti_join(nonlin_df, train_df, by = "id")

ggplot(train_df, aes(x = x, y = y)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_point(data = test_df, color = "red")
```

Fit three models of varying goodness:

  - Linear regression, which generally doesn’t work as well

  - Smooth curve

  - Wiggly
    model

<!-- end list -->

``` r
linear_mod = lm(x ~ x, data = train_df)
```

    ## Warning in model.matrix.default(mt, mf, contrasts): the response appeared
    ## on the right-hand side and was dropped

    ## Warning in model.matrix.default(mt, mf, contrasts): problem with term 1 in
    ## model.matrix: no columns are assigned

``` r
smooth_mod = mgcv::gam(y ~ s(x), data = train_df)
wiggly_mod = mgcv::gam(y ~ s(x, k = 30), sp = 10e-6, data = train_df)
```

Let’s look at some fits.

``` r
train_df %>%
  add_predictions(linear_mod) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_point(aes(y = pred), color = "red")
```

``` r
train_df %>%
  add_predictions(smooth_mod) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line(aes(y = pred), color = "red")
```

``` r
train_df %>%
  add_predictions(wiggly_mod) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line(aes(y = pred), color = "red")
```
